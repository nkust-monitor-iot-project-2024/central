# IoT Monitor Central Repository

This is a monorepo with the following services:

* [event-aggregator](./cmd/event-aggregator)
* [recognition-facade](./cmd/recognition-facade)

and the gRPC/Protobuf definition, OpenTelemetry, MQ, database modules.

## Run

This project is highly optimized for [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com),
which is the recommended PaaS for this IoT Monitor project.

You should prepare your PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and [EntityRecognition](https://github.com/nkust-monitor-iot-project-2024/recognition) instance.
Besides, you may need to configure [Grafana Alloy](https://grafana.com/oss/alloy-opentelemetry-collector/),
so you can monitor the telemetry of services.

Place the following config.toml in the working directory or `/etc/iotmonitor/config.toml`, `~/.config/iotmonitor/config.toml`:

```toml
# DATABASE
[postgres]
host = "${POSTGRES_HOST}"
port = "5432"  # or leave blank for default
user = "${POSTGRES_USER}"
password = "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"
dbname = "${POSTGRES_DB}"
sslmode = "disable"  # https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html

# TELEMETRY
[telemetry.endpoint.otlp]
endpoint = "localhost:4318"
insecure = true

# SERVICES â€“ Entity Recognition
[service.entityrecognition]
uri = "entity-recognition.your-gpu-machine.internal"
tls = { cert_file = "/etc/iotmonitor/services/entityrecognition/cert.pem", key_file = "/etc/iotmonitor/services/entityrecognition/key.pem" }

# RABBITMQ
[mq]
address = "${RABBITMQ_URI}"
```

To build the service, you should install [Taskfile runner](https://taskfile.dev/usage/), then you can run the command to build the microservices:

```bash
task service-event-aggregator  # task service-[service name], single service
task service-all               # all services
```

Then you can run the service:

```bash
./out/event-aggregator
```

## Development

You should build the protobuf first.

```bash
bash scripts/protoc.sh
```

I use [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) for development, but you can use any editor you like.

If you change the ent schema, you should run the following command to update the schema:

```bash
go generate ./ent
```

## Production deployment
